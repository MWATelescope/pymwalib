# pymwalib is DEPRECATED

The [MWATelescope/mwalib](https://github.com/MWATelescope/mwalib) repo now provides Rust,C/C++ and Python bindings, so this repo is now obsolete and will NO LONGER BE MAINTAINED. Please migrate from pymwalib to mwalib as soon as possible!

The new python [mwalib](https://github.com/MWATelescope/mwalib) bindings are now aligned to be very similar to the Rust API. Converting existing pymwalib code to mwalib should be very straight-forward.

---------

A Python interface for [MWATelescope/mwalib](https://github.com/MWATelescope/mwalib) that provides a simple
interface for reading MWA correlator raw visibilities, recombined voltages and exposing the relevant metadata. pymwalib and mwalib
both support reading data produced by the existing (legacy) MWA and the new MWAX systems.

See [pymwalib Wiki](https://github.com/MWATelescope/pymwalib/wiki) for installation and usage infomation.
